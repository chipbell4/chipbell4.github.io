        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p id="intro">
        Hi! My name is Chip Bell and I'm a developer in DC area. I currently work for PBS KIDS building educational
        apps and games for kids. I have a background in web development in PHP and JavaScript, along with graphics and
        applied math. In the past, I've also been a volunteer coach for the <a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/">Mercer University competitive
        programming team</a> and I'm an intermediate-level Spanish-speaker. Â¡Gracias por vistarme! Thanks for stopping
        by!
        </p>
        <h2>Some Stuff I've Done</h2>
        <ul id="experiments-list">
            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="./demos/dead-eye/index.html">Dead Eye</a></h2>
                Dead Eye is a Halloween-themed shooting gallery in the style of the Atari 5200. It uses no external assets
                aside from the score font; everything else is rendered/sythesized on-the-fly for the game, making the total
                weight of the game come in at around 100KB.
            </li>
            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="demos/wave/index.html">Wave Simulation</a></h2>
                This was a grad-school project where I used FEM analysis to simulate a drum head in real-time. The demo allows you to draw your own drumhead, and it can triangulate that into a mesh that it can feed into a FEM simulation. It incorporates the wave equation with both a dampening term and elasiticty.
            </li>
            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="./demos/nes/index.html">NES Sequencer</a></h2>
                In this sequencer, I used the WebAudio API to emulate the Audio Processing Unit of the original Nintendo
                Entertainment System. I've also provided some demo songs too. The <a href="https://github.com/chipbell4/nes-sequencer">README on GitHub</a>
                has a write-up of some of the implementation details, and how you could make your own songs.
            </li>

            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="./demos/water-color/index.html">Water Colors</a></h2>
                This is a tiny canvas drawing tool that emulates water color drawing.
            </li>

            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="./demos/l-system/index.html">L System Viewer</a></h2>
                I also wrote a viewer for L-Systems, rule-based systems for building strings. Surprisingly simple patterns can be used to construct very beautiful, complex structures.
            </li>

            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/Judge">Judge</a></h2>
                Judge is programming contest administration software written in PHP and Laravel 4. I've used for the last
                2 years or so to help run practices for Mercer University. It has a <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/MercerBinaryBears/Judge?branch=develop">full test suite</a>
                and is fairly painless to setup and manage.
            </li>

            <li class="experiment">
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/problem-sets">Problem Set Manager</a></h2>
                The problem set manager serves as an archive for past competition problems for students. It allows me, a
                coach, to upload a PDF of a problem set and split it into multiple PDFs (one for each problem in the set).
                I can then tag each problem under various topics such as Graph Theory or Combinatorics, and upload
                test data sets and solutions for students to use when practicing and learning.
            </li>

import { scale } from './bg/point.js';
import { ctx, drawTriangles } from './bg/canvas.js';
import { splitMultiple } from './bg/penrose-triangle.js';
import { frameBudget } from './bg/frame-control.js';

console.log('Building out the triangle...');
frameBudget(splitMultiple(5)).then(result => {
    // scale all of the points up some
    console.log('About to scale');
    for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
        for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
            result[i][k] = scale(result[i][k], 1000);
        }
    }

    drawTriangles(result);
});
