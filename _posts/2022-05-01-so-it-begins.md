Well, I finally did it. I'm starting a blog, and (I think) I am doing the Right Wayâ„¢.
There are so many platforms, tools, and resources on starting a blog, but _actually_ starting one is difficult for me for some reason.
No more.
I think it's time I build something for myself, and for others.

The purpose of this blog thing is two-fold:
- Encourage me to go out and build stuff
- Share what I learned along the way in both an effort to build others up.

I hope that I acheive that aim. Wish me luck.
