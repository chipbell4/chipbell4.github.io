short_description: A short chorale based on "From Past to Present" from the game Skyrim
---

My wife and I played in a wind ensemble for a short while together in early 2025.
During one of our everyday chats, my wife brought up the idea of performing this song from Skyrim, which arguably is one the pretties ones in the game.
I thought it'd make a great chorale for a few reasons:
- The chord progression isn't a commonplace hymn or something like that
- It's got those nice Bâ™® which is great tuning note for brass instruments. The low, three-valve B concert on trumpet tends to be sharp, and trombone players tend to play it too far in (and therefore sharp).

It's not difficult, nor long, so I think it makes a great chorale piece.
