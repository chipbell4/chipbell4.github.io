short_description: A short arrangement of "God Bless America" I did for the Flute Choir in Gettysburg, PA
---

This is my first attempt at writing for flute choir, and it's an interesting process:
For one, alto flute is essentially the only instrument I can think of that transposes in G.
Moreover, the actual range of the ensemble is really skewed high!
A bass flute's lowest note is C3, an octave below middle C.
That's hardly a "bass" instrument by my reckoning but because you have such a huge spread upwards you still have a lot of range to work with!

I suspect the first playthrough of this will reveal many beginner mistakes in writing for this wonderful ensemble,
especially for those lower-ranged flutes.
Either way, I think this was a fun first foray!
