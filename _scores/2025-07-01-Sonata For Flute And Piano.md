short_description: A four-movement sonata for flute and piano
---

This is my first sonata and I wanted to write something that captured my wife's love of Celtic music but also some of my own VGM sensibilities.
There is some structure to this work, but it's pretty loose.
I almost considered calling this a collection of "lyrical pieces" but stuck with sonata.
