short_description: A transcription of the song "Fujiyama" by the Dave Brubek Quartet
---

This is from their 1964 album "Jazz Impressions of Japan".
Probably some of my favorite lyrical playing from Paul Desmond.
[I also did this one on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Zk9YuBHgbOs?si=uy0ytRZMxKnQVJN3), which is why I originally transcribed it.
