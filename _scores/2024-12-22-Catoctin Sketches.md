short_description: A multi-movement piano piece inspired by the Catoctin Mountains here in Maryland
---

One thing I love about where I live in Maryland is the fall here in the mountains.
That last week of October is incredible: all the leaves are changing and the weather is perfect.
This piece is inspired by that feeling with movements referencing moss on rocks, that first really cold rain in November, and trilling calls from robins you hear in the park.
