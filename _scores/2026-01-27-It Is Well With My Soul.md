short_description: An arrangement of the classic hymn for flute choir
---

My second arrangement for flute choir I've done.
I stuck with the original key of D♭, much to the chagrin of alto flute players everywhere.
In my defense, I don't stay there long and it makes its way to a heroic A major section!
Originally I had planned to try and modulate to E major, but I just couldn't seem to work it out.
The muses finally pointed me toward that funky transition section and we ended up in A.

This arrangement also has a contrabass and piano part!

I tried my darndest to get those parts to fit on a single page, but gave up.
I think it actually reads better as a result ¯\\\(ツ)/¯
