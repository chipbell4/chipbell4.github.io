short_description: An arrangement of the Beatles' song "Penny Lane" for Brass Band
---

I'm sure a million other people have done this arrangement, but I wanted to get some practice arranging for British-style brass band so I did this song
This is probably my favorite Beatles song, and the piccolo trumpet solo really sits well in the E♭ cornet.
The original is in B major for the verses and A major for the chorus.
I lowered that half-step to B♭ and A♭ which puts in really nice keys for brass players.
I'm still not sure if 12/8 was the right choice, or if 4/4 would have been better...
