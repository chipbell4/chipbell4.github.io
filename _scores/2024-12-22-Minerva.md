short_description: A short, multi-movement piano piece about my dog, Minerva
---

Minerva is a short, multi-movement piano piece chronicling a day in the life of my dog, Minerva.
This is loosely inspired by some of the Erik Satie's pieces, especially _Véritables Préludes flasques_ (pour un chien) and I hope I've captured at least a little of Satie's fun and absurdity.
Each movement tracks one of Minerva's activities in her busy day, like:
- Waking up, reluctantly
- Playing fetch, but getting distracted by smells on the way to the park
- Taking a nap, but waking up constantly to bark at random things
- Chasing the cat around
- Eating dinner
- Going to bed, reluctantly

Minerva's got a tough life.
