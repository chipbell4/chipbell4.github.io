short_description: A jazzy brass quintet arrangement of Frosty the Snowman
---

I wrote this arrangement for a brass quintet I played with in downtown Frederick in December of 2024.
Looking back, I'd do a few things differently:
- The horn part is all over the place. I think I should have gotten more feedback from my horn players.
- Make it easier: we actually didn't have a ton of rehearsal time so I think I should have gone for something more "readable". We sight-read most everything at the performance. This should have been sight-readable.

Lessons learned.
