short_description: A little arrangement of Greensleeves for my wife and me to play together
---

My wife really likes this song, so I arranged it for us to play together.
There's nothing really of note here, but I did give myself some fun counterlines for lyrical playing practice.
I also put it in tenor clef for my own practice, which I was less comfortable with at the time.
