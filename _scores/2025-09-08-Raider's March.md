short_description: A brass quintet arrangement of the main theme from the Indiana Jones movies
---

I did this one for some of my brass quintet friends here in Frederick.
The original score for orchestra is pretty brass-heavy, so the "compression" into a brass quintet arrangement was easier than it could have been.
