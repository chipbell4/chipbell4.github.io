short_description: The trombone solo from "Lamento" by Tom Jobim
---

This is a short little solo from "Lamento" on the album "Wave" by Tom Jobim.
I believe it's played by Urbie Green.

I really like this little snippet because of how melodic and interesting it is, while remaining really musical and understated. That run up the C scale he does is really clean too!

I notated this in treble clef mainly because it sits so high. It's not transposed or anything.
