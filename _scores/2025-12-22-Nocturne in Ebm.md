short_description: A short piano piece in the style of Chopin's Nocturnes
---

This is intended to be a bit of a synthesis between Chopin's Op. 9 No. 2 piece in E♭ major that many learn as a piano student, and perhaps some jazz improvisation.
I've written in some ornamentation manually, but if I were to play this myself live I'd probably improvise that some.
The chord progression is E♭m, A♭m, Fsus7, F♭ (the F♭ is replaced by a B♭7/F the second time around), and I'd probably approach this modally.
E♭ Aeolian, Dorian, and even Phrygian will work great depending on the chord, but I'd decided use E♭ harmonic minor for that B♭7.
Blues idioms would also work but maybe feel a little less "Chopin-y" IMO.
