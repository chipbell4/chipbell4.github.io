short_description: An arrangement of Happy Birthday I did for my friend Tom
---

This is a short little arrangement of Happy Birthday that I did for my friend Tom on his birthday.
The melody is in E♭, but the harmony roams around in A♭-ish, and neighboring keys.

Upon listening to it again, it could certainly pass for something from Chrono Trigger....
