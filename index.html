Hello. My name is Chip Bell and I'm a software engineer in the DC area.
I have experience in lot's of random things, like high-scale native cloud development, building HTML5 games, and applied math.
I'm an experienced jazz pianist, and an intermediate Spanish speaker.
Perhaps my blog will combine these random things in an interesting way...

<div class="archive">
  {% for post in site.posts %} {% assign currDate = post.date | date: "%Y" %} {%
  if currDate != date %}
  <h1 class="archive-year">{{ currDate }}</h1>
  {% assign date = currDate %} {% endif %}
  <div class="archive-item">
    <span class="post-date archive-date fs-4"
      >{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</span
    >
    <a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}" class="archive-title fs-4"
      >{{ post.title }}</a
    >
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
