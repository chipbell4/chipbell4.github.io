        Hi! My name is Chip Bell and I'm a developer in DC area. I currently work for PBS KIDS building educational
        apps and games for kids. I have a background in web development in PHP and JavaScript, along with graphics and
        applied math. I also coach the <a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/">Mercer University competitive
        programming team</a> and I'm an intermediate-level Spanish-speaker. Â¡Gracias por vistarme! Thanks for stopping
        by!

            <dd>
            Judge is programming contest administration software written in PHP and Laravel 4. I've used for the last
            2 years or so to help run practices for Mercer University. It has a <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/MercerBinaryBears/Judge?branch=develop">full test suite</a>
            and is fairly painless to setup and manage.

            <dt><a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/problem-sets">Problem Set Manager</a></dt>
            <dd>
            The problem set manager serves as an archive for past competition problems for students. It allows me, a
            coach, to upload a PDF of a problem set and split it into multiple PDFs (one for each problem in the set).
            I can then tag each problem under various topics such as Graph Theory or Combinatorics, and upload
            test data sets and solutions for students to use when practicing and learning.
