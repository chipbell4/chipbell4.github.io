        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>
        Hi! My name is Chip Bell and I'm a developer in DC area. I currently work for PBS KIDS building educational
        apps and games for kids. I have a background in web development in PHP and JavaScript, along with graphics and
        applied math. In the past, I've also been a volunteer coach for the <a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/">Mercer University competitive
        programming team</a> and I'm an intermediate-level Spanish-speaker. Â¡Gracias por vistarme! Thanks for stopping
        by!
        </p>
        <h2>Some Stuff I've Done</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="./demos/dead-eye/index.html">Dead Eye</a></dt>
            <dd>
            Dead Eye is a Halloween-themed shooting gallery in the style of the Atari 5200. It uses no external assets
            aside from the score font; everything else is rendered/sythesized on-the-fly for the game, making the total
            weight of the game come in at around 100KB.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="./demos/nes/index.html">NES Sequencer</a></dt>
            <dd>
            In this sequencer, I used the WebAudio API to emulate the Audio Processing Unit of the original Nintendo
            Entertainment System. I've also provided some demo songs too. The <a href="https://github.com/chipbell4/nes-sequencer">README on GitHub</a>
            has a write-up of some of the implementation details, and how you could make your own songs.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/Judge">Judge</a></dt>
            <dd>
            Judge is programming contest administration software written in PHP and Laravel 4. I've used for the last
            2 years or so to help run practices for Mercer University. It has a <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/MercerBinaryBears/Judge?branch=develop">full test suite</a>
            and is fairly painless to setup and manage.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://github.com/MercerBinaryBears/problem-sets">Problem Set Manager</a></dt>
            <dd>
            The problem set manager serves as an archive for past competition problems for students. It allows me, a
            coach, to upload a PDF of a problem set and split it into multiple PDFs (one for each problem in the set).
            I can then tag each problem under various topics such as Graph Theory or Combinatorics, and upload
            test data sets and solutions for students to use when practicing and learning.
