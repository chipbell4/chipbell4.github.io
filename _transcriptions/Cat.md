short_description: The head from the titular song from Hiroshi Suzuki's album "Cat"
---

This is a transcription of just the head of Cat, and not Hiroshi's solo.
I plan on getting around to transcribing it, but I haven't gotten to it yet.

There are some interesting things I learned doing this one that I think are worth pointing out:
- The keyboard part is basically a chord shape that's moved around block-wise. It sounds cool, but also has a certain "ergonomics" to it that I think make it really fun to play (while also sounding super "Jazz Fusionâ„¢").
- Hiroshi Suzuki's tone on this album is super "tinny" to me, and I think that's because he uses a very shallow mouthpiece. Eventually I'll get around to 3D printing some mouthpieces and I'll see if I can replicate it.
- A corollary of the shallow mouthpiece theory is that he plays pretty effortlessly in a super high range for the entire album. I mean, he has incredible chops but I think the mouthpiece probably helps some.
